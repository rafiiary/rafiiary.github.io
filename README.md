## Currently
I'm a first-year graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).

## Research Interests
I'm mainly interested in Compilers, Programming Languages, and Systems Design and Implementations.

## Previously
I received my Honours Bachelor of Science from University of Toronto, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. After graduation, I spent over a year working at [Amazon Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/) as a software developer in Vancouver, Canada before deciding to head back to graduate school in Toronto.

I also spent a year working at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) as an intern where I was the lead engineer on developing the backend for [Blender3D](https://www.blender.org/) to use the Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP) [ROCm](https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/servers-solutions-rocm) platform.

## Hobbies
I enjoy playing football, hiking, mountain climbing, spending time with friends and family, and reading.

If you have any book suggestions, please let me know!
