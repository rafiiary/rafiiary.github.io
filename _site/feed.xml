&lt;p&gt;I often find myself thinking about different concepts and enaging in conversations in my own head. Most of the time, I do this because there is something that is not clear in my mind. So I question why I believe certain things and then try to come up with explanations for them. Generally, these things are academic or work related, but sometimes they are philosophical and quite personal. Usually, my opinions and beliefs change through this process and I end up with a much more clear and cohesive vision of the things I believe and (more importantly) why I believe them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the human memory (at least mine) is not as capable as that of a computer. Therefore, even though my core understandings might subconsciously stick around, I forget most of my detailed thoughts a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m hoping this website will change that. First of all it will help me organise my thoughts through thorough thinking and self-conversing (and written communication in posts). Second, it allows me to keep these conversations in a centralized place into which I can tap whenever I wish (and laugh at my past stupidity once in a while).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that all my opinions on here are my own and never reflect any institutions or companies with which I am affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason, you are reading this now, I am both surprised and honored; welcome. I hope in some way, this is also beneficial for you :)&lt;/p&gt;
