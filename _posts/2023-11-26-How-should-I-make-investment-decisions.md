Recently, I had a conversation with two dear friends of mine about investments and as expected in 2023, the topic of cryptocurrencies came up. I was pleased to find out that none of us had ever invested in crypto. This made me think deeper about how I make investment decisions and I think it's an interesting topic so I'm writing about it on here.

From talking to and hearing from people, I believe almost everyone's investment philosohpy falls into two categories based on their goals. The first one is what I like to call *offensive* investing. This is when a person is actively trying to increase their monetary wealth through smart (and sometimes not so smart) investments. These investments are typically short-term; an example would be a day trader who tries to buy assets and sell them later in the same day for a higher price. This is an obvious attempt to finish the day with more money than the beginning of the day, i.e. increasing monetary wealth. The second category is what I refer to as *defensive* investing, which is when a person invests some of his money in hopes that the value of his assets don't depreciate over time, at least keeping up with inflation. This type of investing is usually a long-term investment.

I have some thoughts about day traders and short-term investors but I don't care to talk about them in this post. Instead, I'll mainly focus on long-term investments.

There are a couple of factors at play when making investment decisions. However, I think the most important question that a potential investor should consider is the following:

### In what type of world do I want to live?

I believe that if you have the answer to this question, then a big portion of your decision making regarding the types of investment you want to make is done. This might ruffle some feathers but in my opinion, choosing the increase in monetary wealth as the sole purpose of an investment is a ridiculous idea. It is exactly how we reach a world where people "invest" into cryptocurrencies and give money to scammers like [Logan Paul and Cryptozoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=386p68_lDHA).

To make this claim really clear, let's go through a thought experiment: Imagine a company who promises to give you 500% profit per day for the money you invest. You also know for a fact that this company is not scamming you and will actually give you the promised returns. What does the company do? They are building a bomb that will destroy the planet. Are you still going to invest in them? I hope not. While this example is extreme, I've given it to highlight the problems that could arise when an investor prioritizes money over all else.

So what *should* you prioritize instead of growing your bank balance? First, answer the question about the type of world in which you would like to live. Then, you can look for companies whose values align with yours. If you would like to live in a world where everyone moves around on their hands instead of their feet, then you should probably invest your money in a company that teaches people how to do handstands and "walk" using their arms. In this way, you are not just investing your money for monetary profits, you are also helping build the world in which you would like to live. This philosophy of investment is what I call the double-win investment. It is because if the company succeeds, then you are both wealthier monetarily and live in a better world because of your support for the said company.

So now I come back to the conversation that sparked this post. The question becomes: What does crypto provide to the world? Does it change the world in any way that aligns with my values? As far as I can tell, no. It adds no value to the world in a meaningful way, produces no real product, and for those reasons (among many more), I have never invested in it.

But what do I know? I'm just a guy with some opinions.
